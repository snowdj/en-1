This post is about the opinions tweeted & retweeted by the most influential users of Sina Weibo. 

About Sina Weibo, you can refer to the webpage of [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sina_Weibo#cite_note-3):

> Sina Weibo (Chinese: 新浪微博; pinyin: Xīnlàng Wēibó; literally “Sina Microblog”) is a Chinese microblogging (weibo) website. Akin to a hybrid of Twitter and Facebook, it is one of the most popular sites in China, in use by well over 30% of Internet users, with a similar market penetration that Twitter has established in the USA. It was launched by SINA Corporation on 14 August 2009, and has more than 300 million registered users as of February 2012. 

To study the news diffusion of Weibo Users, My collaborator Linwu and I had set up a research project of Weibo Landscape aiming at archiving the historical tweets of 800 verified weibo accounts (Rich club of Sina Weibo) before March 2012. Both the tweets created by them and the tweets retweeted by them are collected and indexed. So this archive can supply you the historical opinions reflected by these most influential users: including 400 media accounts+100 website accounts+ 100 government accounts +100 celebrities accounts+100 grass root accounts

How does the media landscape look like?

### The Opinions of the Rich Club

Understanding the rich club, see [my slides here](http://chengjun.github.io/slides/strut/richclub/):

- the weighted rich-club effect tests whether a select group 
of nodes share their strongest ties with each other in a 
weighted network (Opsahl et al., 2008)
- 80-20 rule  (Pareto, 1897)
- high degree nodes form many ties with each other 
(Borgatti and Everett, 1999; Colizza et al., 2006; Newman, 2002)

Although Sina Weibo is very densely connected, Individuals are separated from each other but closer to the celebrities. Thus the most influential users become the core of Sina Weibo, and they are followed by the common users. As the core of Sina Weibo, they have great influence on the information diffusion on the social media website.

- 800 Influential Users (400 media accounts+100 website accounts+ 100-government accounts +100 celebrities accounts+100 grass root accounts) are identified by Sina Weibo.

- The data were collected though user timeline api using Python. 
The following relationship of the rich club reveals that they are closed connected (see the figure below).

What is the relationship between rich club, random sample, and the unsampled majority in our data?

### Visualization of diffusion path

Click the source of the top 1000 list of archive items, you can get the url of a given tweet, and then you can further visualize the diffusion path using the apps of Sina Weibo.

- [newgraph](http://newgraph.sinaapp.com/)

For example, using the doodod, you can visualize the diffusion path following [this link](http://www.doodod.com/doodod/chuanbo?weiboURL=http://weibo.com/1893278624/xrv9ZEuLX). The figure looks like this:

######The Landscape of Information Diffusion on Sina Weibo： 
Investigating the Rich-Club Effect

This blog post is derived from my project of information diffusion on Sina Weibo. Based on the data of weibo landscape, we find that: 

Rich-club as a closely connected community in networks has important influences on the information flow within the online social system. We study the competing mechanisms underlying the information flows within and among different social groups inside the rich club of Sina Weibo. The results demonstrate that: first, there is relatively strong rich-club effect in both influential users and random sampled users; second, social selection, geographic proximity, and social influence have significant influence on the information flow within the rich-club for different social groups, and the impact of social influence is overwhelmingly strong. The implications help shed new light on our knowledge about the underlying mechanisms of information diffusion on the microblog.

In the following post, I will introduce how to scrape data from Sina Weibo using Python.
