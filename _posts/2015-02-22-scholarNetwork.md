## Introduction

scholarNetwork is a python package for crawling and visualizing the co-author network of Google Scholar.

To use it, you must have access to Google Scholar, and you would also install beautifulsoup4 and networkx during the installation process.

## Install
Install from pypi using pip or easy_install

	     pip install scholarNetwork

or

	     easy_install scholarNetwork

##Use

    	from scholarNetwork import scholarNetwork
    	import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    	import networkx as nx
    
    	## The seed of crawler
    	seed = 'https://scholar.google.nl/citations?user=nNdt_G8AAAAJ&hl=en&oe=ASCII'
    	## How many nodes do you want to visulize? Always start with a small one. 
    	Nmax = 21
    	## Get the graph g
    	g = scholarNetwork.getGraph(seed, Nmax)
    
    	## plot the network
    	pos=nx.spring_layout(g) #setup the layout
    
    	nx.draw(g, pos, node_shape = 'o',
    			edge_color = 'gray', width = 0.5,
    			with_labels = True, arrows = True)
    	plt.show()

Of course, you can get a much larger graph to see what's happening around you, just to change the value of Nmax. However, you have to be patient to wait for much longer time.
