This is my reading report about the book titled The craft of Research. The author reminds readers to remember three questions for making claims: First, what kind of claims should I ask? Second, is the claim specific enough? Third, will it significant enough to need an argument supporting it? 

These questions are principles of thumb because of their close relevance with the logic of research. Our claims are always used to address the research questions, and the arguments or sub-arguments are used to defend our claims. When we make claims, we should think about what the kind of the research question is. “The kind of problem you pose determines the kind of claim you make and the kind of argument you need to support it.”( Booth, 2003, p120). So the first question is about determining the kinds of claims we make. Claims can be divided into two kinds: practical claims and conceptual ones. Although scholars value conceptual claims more than practical ones in order to help people to understand things rather than to ask people to act, there is also relevance between them. However, the authors remind us to make clear about the kinds of the claims because they need different arguments. And we should no inflate the significance of conceptual claims by emphasizing the action. Instead, we can suggest a practical application of our conceptual claims in the conclusion parts.
 
The next step is to evaluate the claim to make it both specific and significant. In most of the cases, we can’t express clearly not because our language skills, but because we haven’t thought it through. So it’s important to keep the logic specific first. The authors suggest new learners to write more terms in our earlier versions to help us to think the claims over, and then we can condense the sentences with more concise words. According to the principle of Occam’ razor, we should only include the concepts which act as the themes of the arguments into our claims.
 
In order to make claims specific, the authors suggest us to write working claim with qualifying clause beginning with although or even though and to conclude working claim with because: (1) Although I acknowledge X, (2) I claim Y, (3) because of reason Z. This is very helpful. For example, I revise my former claim as following: although earlier research acknowledge of mass media and reference group’s impact on the spiral of silence, I claim reference group’s interplay with the mass media can also lead to a reversed spiral of silence, because of the interactions within and among the reference groups may lead to different opinions with that of the mass media, especially when media’s influence is weaker than that of the reference groups. 

In addition, the authors’ suggestions of qualifying claims to enhance credibility by acknowledging limiting conditions and using hedges to limit certainty are also very helpful.
