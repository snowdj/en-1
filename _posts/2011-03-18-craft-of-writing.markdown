Howard S. Becker is a sociologist of America, who writes the book Writing for Social Scientists, and generously shares his experience and insightful understanding of writing. He analyzes the writing issues in the perspective of sociology, which is very interesting. However, the most important factor, which makes this book successful, is the frankness which moves a lot of people. This is interesting, because there are so many books devote themselves to improve the public’s writing skills, but most of them only tell us what we should do, rather than writing in the perspective of readers. 

He works as an anthropologist, and treat his class as a field work. He asks his students whose fears of writing overshadow their torture of taking class of composition again, to share their experience of writing, which convinces readers that all of us share common patterns of writing. We treat writing as a work which should be done once, which is of course a difficult job to finish. So we turn to all kinds of rituals which waste a lot time. What we should do is start to write right now. 

Howard S. Becker proposes to write clear, understandable, and plain prose. He explain why he did so in chapter 2 of this book, which claims that we write flowery sentences to distinguish ourselves from people in other fields, rather than getting into the real answers of the question. If we aim at pursuing these personas rather than uncovering the hidden pattern of the world, writing means quite different things. 

What we should do is start to write right now. He discusses with us what should we do with the start of writing. For example, write you outline first, and write you introduction last. Writing a sentence doesn’t hurt you, and it even helps you to find out what you have and what you would like to say. It helps to sort out your thoughts and make your words physically. Don’t intend to be critical at this phase. This example reminds me about YAN Gengwang’s reflection about the failure of one of his outstanding peers who seldom begins to write until he feels he had got ready for it. The result is, in his life, he only writes one piece of paper which is insightful but very short. 

Another important part is how to begin, which I have great passions on. Wright, C. Mills share his secrets of doing research, he makes notes on all the aspects of a specific topic, and shuffles the notes to re-combine the different concepts in order to get the imagination of sociology. Howard S. Becker holds similar, but more concrete ideas.” Begin by taking notes on what you have written, put each idea on a file card.” Then sort your stack of cards into files, and sequence the files. Howard reminds us from the first time we can be critical at the first time. We can put out the generalization cards on a table, a door, or a wall. In addition to that, if we can’t find the one right way, Howard suggests us to talk about why we can’t, and why you choose a less-than-perfect solution, and what it all means. We can’t solve the question in one paper. 

He asserts that scholars must learn to write professionally. He gives us his own experience of submitting a paper to American Journal of Sociology. Everett Hughes reviews this paper and comments that his sentences sounded like they have been translated from German. Another example I know is given by CHEN GuanRong, who is professor of city university of Hong Kong. Chen said that if you write you paper within three days and submit it out without editing, it’s unlikely to be accepted by the journal because even the reviewers have to spend two weeks to read through your paper and give their comments which are usually very long and written carefully. 

Howard further discuss about a lot of things on write as a professional, risks of sitting down to write (which means trust your peers and yourself), submitting, literature review, and writing with computers. Most of them are very interesting and will surprise me. I’ll re-read this classic piece of work to direct my writing and studies. 

Last, I want to quote Howard’s words, “they don’t argue with me, they just don’t do it”. I’d like to act to test Howard’s advices. Hopefully, I can apply them into my research project.
