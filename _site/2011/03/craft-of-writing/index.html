<p>As an American sociologist, Howard S. Becker writes the book titled Writing for Social Scientists in which he generously shares his experience and insightful understandings by analyzing the writing issues in the perspective of sociology. Howard works in the way of anthropology and treats his classroom of writing as a field of observation. </p>

<p>First, He asks his students whose fears of writing overshadow their torture of taking class of composition again,to share their experience of writing, which convinces readers that all of us share <strong>common problems</strong> of writing: instead of treating writing as a work which should be done at once, we turn to all the rituals we know and as a result waste a lot time. How to solve this problem? The answer is quite simple but very useful: </p>

<h1 id="to-start-the-writing-right-now"><strong>to start the writing right now!!!!</strong></h1>

<p>Further, He discusses what to do in the beginning of writing. <strong>Write an outline first, and write your introduction last.</strong> Writing a sentence doesn’t hurt you, and it even helps you to find out what you have and what you would like to say. It helps to sort your thoughts. <strong>Don’t intend to be critical at this phase.</strong> This suggestion reminds me about YAN Gengwang’s reflection about the failure of his friend who is believed to be very promising in history research but seldom begins to write until he feels he had got ready for it. It turns out that he only writes one piece of paper  in his life. </p>

<p>Second, Howard S. Becker proposes to write clear, understandable, and plain prose. He explains why he did so in chapter 2 of this book, which claims that we write flowery sentences to merely distinguish ourselves from others to pursue these personas rather than answering the research questions. </p>

<p>Third and an important part is how to prepare for the writing, on which I have great passions. C. Wright Mills share his &#8220;secrets&#8221; of doing research: making notes on a specific topic, and shuffles the notes to combine the different concepts in order to get the imagination of sociology. Howard S. Becker holds similar but more concrete ideas. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Begin by taking notes on what you have written, put each idea on a file card. Then sort your stack of cards into files, and sequence the files. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Howard reminds us to be critical at this time. We can put out the <strong>generalization cards</strong> on a table, a door, or a wall. </p>

<p>If we can’t find the right way, Howard suggests us to talk about why we can’t, and why you choose a less-than-perfect solution, and what it all means: we can’t solve the question in one paper. </p>

<p>Scholars must learn to write professionally. He gives us his own experience of submitting a paper to American Journal of Sociology. Everett Hughes reviews this paper and comments that his sentences sounded like they have been translated from German. The solution is to proofread it first.</p>

<p>To carefully polish your paper before submission is necessary for non-native speakers. CHEN Guanrong, a professor of city university of Hong Kong, shares his comments on it. Chen said that if you write you paper within three days and submit it out without editing, it’s unlikely to be accepted by the journal. Even the reviewers have to spend two weeks to read through your paper and give their comments which are usually very long and carefully written. </p>

<p>Becker further discussed a lot of things on writing as a professional, risks of sitting down to write (which means to trust your peers and yourself), submitting, literature review, and writing with computers. Most of them are very interesting. </p>

<p>Last, do not be defensive. I want to quote Howard’s words:</p>

<h1 id="they-dont-argue-with-me-they-just-dont-do-it">“they don’t argue with me, they just don’t do it”.</h1>
